Here’s a structured talk script you can use for your proposal to better manage squad hygiene items:

**Title: Proposal for Centralized Squad Hygiene Tracking**

**1. Introduction**

Hi everyone,
I’d like to take a few minutes to propose a new approach for managing our squad hygiene items more effectively. Right now, we’re tracking hygiene tasks in different places or on an ad-hoc basis, which makes it hard to get a full picture, follow up consistently, or spot cross-impact.

---

**2. The Problem Today**

Currently:

* Hygiene items are tracked separately by different people.
* There's no single source of truth.
* Some items get missed or not updated regularly.
* It's hard to prioritize or coordinate fixes, especially for items that impact multiple projects.

---

**3. The Proposal**

To address this, I propose:

* **Creating a centralized Excel file** that lists all squad hygiene items.
* The file will have:

  * A **summary sheet** showing high-level hygiene items.
  * One **detailed sheet per item** tracking:

    * Related impacted projects
    * Owners
    * Status updates
    * Risk level or blockers

---

**4. How It Will Work**

* Each owner will be responsible for keeping their hygiene item updated in the Excel file.
* Every **two weeks**, I’ll review the summary and:

  * **Highlight items** that need attention.
  * **Bring them to the meeting** for quick discussion.
* For hygiene items that have **wider impact**, we’ll take time during the meeting to:

  * Align on next steps
  * Decide on a fix or remediation plan
  * Identify any support needed

---

**5. Benefits**

* Single, transparent source of truth
* Easier to track progress and accountability
* Improves coordination across projects
* Helps us spot hygiene risks before they become blockers

---

**6. Next Steps**

* I’ll draft the Excel structure and share it by \[insert date].
* Once ready, I’ll walk through it with everyone and assign initial owners.
* From there, we’ll make it part of our regular hygiene check-ins every two weeks.

---

**7. Closing**

This approach should make hygiene tracking more structured and collaborative, without adding too much overhead.
Open to suggestions, and happy to adapt the structure based on feedback once we start using it.

Thank you!
