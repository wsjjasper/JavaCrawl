Thanks, that‚Äôs a very clear case. Based on what you described ‚Äî a process that is really a **workflow made of steps**, with a step graph that could come from **ORK+ generated Autosys jobs** or a **Camunda BPMN flow** ‚Äî the **Process Definition data model** should reflect both the *workflow as a whole* and the *steps inside it*. Here‚Äôs how I would structure it conceptually:

---

## Process Definition (Concept Model)

### 1. **Process Profile (Workflow Level)**

* Identity and metadata for the process as a whole.

  * `process_key` (stable ID)
  * `business_name`, `description`
  * `engine_orchestrator` (ORK+, Camunda, Autosys box, etc.)
  * `owner_team`, `owner_contact`
  * `lifecycle_status`
* This defines the **logical ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù process**.

---

### 2. **Process I/O Contract**

* Declares what datasets this process consumes and produces.
* Evaluated **at process start** to fetch all inputs (dataset instances, schema versions, partitions).
* Ties the workflow to the data domain.

---

### 3. **Process Step Definitions**

* Each step has its own row/record:

  * `step_id`, `step_name`
  * `engine_type` (Java, Spark, DB2\_SP, Python, Shell, etc.)
  * `artifact_uri` (JAR, YAML, stored procedure name, script path)
  * `artifact_digest`, `vcs_commit_sha` (for drift detection)
  * `runtime_config` (parameters, memory, queue, etc.)
* This is where you capture the **implementation unit per step**.

---

### 4. **Step Graph Definition**

* The directed graph of step dependencies inside the process.
* Could reference:

  * ORK+ job graph (Autosys jobs + dependencies)
  * Camunda BPMN model (step nodes, transitions)
* Stored as:

  * `PROCESS_STEP_GRAPH (parent_step_id, child_step_id, dependency_type)`
* Defines the **execution order / branching logic**.

---

### 5. **Process Instance (Workflow Run)**

* Each trigger of the process creates one `process_instance_id`.
* Tracks lifecycle of the whole graph execution:

  * start/end timestamps
  * trigger type (schedule, event, manual)
  * status (running, succeeded, failed, partial)
* Links to dataset instances consumed/produced at workflow level.

---

### 6. **Step Instance (Optional, for Forensics)**

* If needed, you can log runs of individual steps inside the workflow:

  * `step_instance_id`, `process_instance_id`, `step_id`
  * start/end, status, exit code
  * links to dataset instances read/written by the step
* Useful for debugging failed steps without losing the abstraction that it‚Äôs part of one process.

---

### 7. **Spec‚ÜíImpl Binding**

* For each step, tie the definition to the actual artifact that ran:

  * `artifact_uri` + hash
  * commit SHA (if versioned in Git)
  * runtime signature (Spark plan hash, DB2 explain hash, etc.)
* Ensures reproducibility and drift detection between **declared spec** and **runtime reality**.

---

## Visually, under **Process Definition** you would have boxes like:

* **Process Profile**
* **Process I/O Contract**
* **Process Step Definitions**
* **Step Graph Definition**
* **Process Instance (workflow run)**
* **Step Instances (optional, child of process instance)**
* **Spec‚ÜíImpl Binding (per step)**

---

üëâ This way, you can represent both:

* **High-level workflow** (one process triggered, with I/O contract)
* **Detailed execution** (step graph, step definitions, bindings, step instances)

Would you like me to **extend the Draw\.io XML diagram** so the Process Definition swimlane explicitly contains these seven boxes (with nesting for ‚ÄúSteps‚Äù and ‚ÄúStep Graph‚Äù)?
