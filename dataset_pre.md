Here’s a refined version of your draft, keeping the meaning but making it **clearer, smoother, and concise** for a non-technical audience:

### **1. What We Mean by “Dataset”**

In our daily work, we often deal with **collections of related data** — for example:

* Loan records
* Trade transactions
* Inventory lists
* Party legal entity details

These collections are what we call **datasets**.

A dataset has a few basic concepts:

* **Schema** – a predefined list of fields and their data types
* **Versions** – different instances of the same dataset when it’s created multiple times
* **Format** – the way it’s stored, such as a parquet file, CSV file, or a database table

---

### **2. Current Situation**

Today, dataset definitions and tracking methods **vary widely** across applications.

* Some legacy applications use XML or YAML files to define their datasets.
* Some modernized applications store dataset definitions in common repositories, but the format and details might not be standardized or even maintained manually.

Without a standardized approach, we face:

* Potential misalignment between squads
* Redundant work
* Extra effort to confirm what’s in a dataset, when it was produced, and where it’s stored

---

### **3. Our Solution**

**First**, we are encouraging all developers to use a **central repository** for storing dataset definitions and their associated metadata.

* This gives us a single, complete view of all existing dataset definitions and registered metadata.

**Second**, we have developed a **suite of standardized APIs** for defining and registering datasets.

* These APIs provide a clear, consistent process for all teams, reducing manual effort and ensuring definitions are aligned across the CRV.

---

### **4. What This Means for Business Users**

* With a **centralized place** to find dataset information, this potentially can make it easier to identify and reference the right dataset
* Also it could provide more **transparency** and **traceability** in how datasets are defined and tracked



> This is **not** a complete solution to all dataset management needs. It’s a **first step** that lays the foundation for easier integration, future automation, and better dataset governance.
