Got it 👍 You’re asking at the “architecture & design thinking” level — if we were to design a generic data model metadata system (something that could support a workspace like Credit Risk but also scale to other domains), what are the main considerations? Let’s brainstorm broadly and then tune to your credit risk workspace use case.

🌐 Big Picture: What Metadata Represents

Metadata is “data about data” — but in a generic data model, you want it to support:

Structural metadata: schemas, fields, types, relationships

Operational metadata: lineage, refresh cycle, owner, quality metrics

Business metadata: meaning, glossary, usage policies, regulatory mappings

Technical metadata: source system, ingestion method, partitioning, formats

🧩 Key Considerations for Generic Metadata Design

1. Dataset Identity & Versioning

Unique dataset identifiers (loan, trade, party, exposure, limit, etc.)

Version control (schema evolution, rollbacks, milestone snapshots)

Effective-dating for time travel (important in risk & regulatory reporting)


2. Schema & Field-Level Metadata

Field name, data type, nullable, constraints

Semantic meaning (e.g., "Exposure Amount" vs "Exposure Limit")

Mapping to business glossary terms

Relationships to other fields/datasets (foreign keys, derived fields)

Support for hierarchical schemas (nested/JSON/XML structures)


3. Lineage & Provenance

Source systems (trading system, treasury, reference data, etc.)

Transformation steps (ETL, Spark job, rule engine output)

Downstream dependencies (risk aggregation, analytics dashboards, regulatory feeds)

“Explainability” trail — especially critical in credit risk


4. Data Quality & Validation Rules

Rule catalog: null checks, range checks, reconciliation with source

Thresholds and severity levels (warning vs. blocking)

Exceptions management (who can override, how tracked)

Data profiling statistics (distribution, outliers)


5. Access Control & Security

Role-based access (credit analyst, regulator, developer, etc.)

Data sensitivity (PII, confidential trades, regulatory restricted)

Masking / tokenization rules

Audit logs of who accessed what metadata


6. Process / Workflow Metadata

Approvals (e.g., credit exposure limit update needs 2 approvals)

Workflow states (draft → pending approval → active)

Ownership (data steward, business owner, IT owner)

SLA & refresh frequency (daily, T+1, intraday, real-time)


7. Regulatory & Compliance Tagging

BCBS 239 lineage compliance

Mapping to regulatory forms/reports (FR Y-14, CCAR, Basel capital rules)

Critical Data Element (CDE) flagging

Retention policies


8. Performance & Storage Optimizations

Partitioning strategy (date, party, product)

Indexing & clustering

Hot vs. cold storage tier metadata

Caching hints


9. Cross-Domain Reusability

Standardized metadata model that can fit loans, trades, limits, exposures

Extensibility for new asset classes (derivatives, securitizations, private equity)

Ability to support both structured (DB2 tables) and unstructured/semi-structured (JSON, XML messages, reports) data


10. User & Customization Needs

User-defined views (analyst may only need party-level exposure)

Derived datasets (aggregation rollups, limit calculations)

Search & discovery (metadata catalog, keyword tagging, business glossary)

Visualization support (entity-relationship maps, lineage graphs)

🎯 Credit Risk Workspace Context

Special considerations for Credit Risk metadata:

1. Exposure vs. Limit alignment – need metadata on how exposures are measured, aggregated, compared to limits.


2. Counterparty hierarchy – legal entity structure, ultimate parent, netting agreements → all require flexible hierarchical metadata.


3. Time dependency – exposures fluctuate intraday, limits update by governance process. Metadata must track as-of-time.


4. Approval flow – limit increase request requires workflow metadata.


5. Scenario/what-if support – metadata should capture simulation runs (e.g., stress tests).


6. Auditability – regulators will ask: where did this exposure number come from, who approved it, when was it last changed?




---

✅ So in short, a generic metadata model should capture:

What the data is (identity, schema, semantics)

Where it came from (lineage, provenance)

How good it is (quality, validation)

Who owns it (governance, workflow, access)

How it evolves (versioning, effective-dating)

Why it matters (business/regulatory linkage)

Would you like me to sketch a conceptual metadata schema (ERD-style) that could serve as a blueprint for this? It could show entities like Dataset, Field, Lineage, QualityRule, Workflow, BusinessTerm, and how they connect — tailored to a Credit Risk workspace.
