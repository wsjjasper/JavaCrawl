I understand the challenge you're facing with very large stored procedures that exceed the token limit of embedding models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`, which has a maximum token limit of **8191 tokens** per request. To process these large stored procedures effectively, we'll need to split them into smaller, meaningful chunks that stay within the token limit while preserving the semantic integrity of the code.

---

### **Strategies to Handle Large Stored Procedures**

#### **1. Split Stored Procedures into Manageable Chunks**

**a. Logical Block Splitting**

- **Identify Logical Boundaries**: Split the stored procedure at logical points such as `BEGIN...END` blocks, loops, conditionals, or transaction statements.
- **Maintain Semantic Integrity**: Ensure that each chunk represents a complete logical unit to preserve meaning.

**b. Statement-Level Splitting**

- **Break Down Statements**: Split the code into individual SQL statements or groups of related statements.
- **Use Separators**: Utilize specific SQL keywords or symbols as separators (e.g., `;`, `END`, `GO`).

**Implementation Example with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`**

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Estimate maximum characters per chunk based on token limit (assuming ~4 chars per token)
max_chunk_chars = 8000 * 4  # Approximately 32,000 characters

separators = [
    ';\nEND;',           # End of a block
    ';\nEND\nGO',        # SQL Server batch terminator
    ';\nGO',             # Batch separator in SQL Server
    ';\n',               # Statement terminator
    '\nCREATE PROCEDURE',  # Start of a procedure
    '\nALTER PROCEDURE',   # Altering a procedure
    'BEGIN\n',           # Start of a block
    'END;\n',            # End of a block
    '\n',                # New lines
    ' ',                 # Spaces
]

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=3000,   # Adjusted to ensure chunks are within token limit
    chunk_overlap=200, # Overlap to maintain context between chunks
    separators=separators
)

# Split the stored procedure
chunks = text_splitter.split_text(large_stored_procedure_text)
```

---

#### **2. Use Advanced Token Counting with `tiktoken`**

To precisely control chunk sizes based on token counts:

**a. Install and Import `tiktoken`**

```bash
pip install tiktoken
```

```python
import tiktoken
```

**b. Initialize the Tokenizer**

```python
# Initialize the tokenizer for the embedding model
tokenizer = tiktoken.encoding_for_model('text-embedding-ada-002')
max_tokens = 8000  # Safe margin under the 8191 limit
```

**c. Create a Token-Aware Splitter**

```python
def split_text_by_tokens(text, tokenizer, max_tokens):
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = ''
    for word in words:
        tentative_chunk = f"{current_chunk} {word}".strip()
        token_count = len(tokenizer.encode(tentative_chunk))
        if token_count > max_tokens:
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append(current_chunk)
            current_chunk = word
        else:
            current_chunk = tentative_chunk
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(current_chunk)
    return chunks

# Split the stored procedure
chunks = split_text_by_tokens(large_stored_procedure_text, tokenizer, max_tokens)
```

---

#### **3. Preserve Context Across Chunks**

**a. Overlapping Chunks**

- **Maintain Continuity**: Use overlapping content between chunks to preserve context.
- **Adjust Overlap Size**: Balance between enough context and token limit.

**b. Metadata Enrichment**

- **Track Position**: Add metadata to each chunk indicating its position (e.g., line numbers, chunk index).
- **Use in Retrieval**: Leverage metadata during search and post-processing to reconstruct the full context.

---

#### **4. Compress and Optimize the Code**

**a. Remove Non-essential Content**

- **Strip Comments**: Remove comments that don't contribute to the code logic.
- **Eliminate Redundant Whitespaces**: Minify the code where possible.

**b. Caution with Minification**

- **Avoid Altering Logic**: Ensure that code minification doesn't change the code's functionality.
- **Test After Compression**: Validate the integrity of the code after compression.

**Example:**

```python
def compress_sql_code(sql_code):
    import re
    # Remove comments
    sql_code = re.sub(r'--.*?(\n|$)', '', sql_code)
    sql_code = re.sub(r'/\*.*?\*/', '', sql_code, flags=re.DOTALL)
    # Remove extra whitespaces
    sql_code = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', sql_code)
    return sql_code.strip()
```

---

#### **5. Summarize Complex Sections**

If certain parts of the stored procedure are too large or less critical:

**a. Manual Summarization**

- **Create Abstracts**: Write summaries of complex sections to reduce size.
- **Focus on Key Logic**: Highlight the main functionality and dependencies.

**b. Use Language Models**

- **Automated Summarization**: Use an LLM to generate summaries of code sections.
- **Caution**: Ensure that the model's output is accurate and doesn't expose sensitive information.

---

#### **6. Utilize Models with Larger Context Windows**

**a. Higher Token Limits**

- **GPT-3.5 Turbo (16k) or GPT-4 (32k)**: These models support larger context windows.
- **Embedding Limitations**: Note that these models may not support embeddings directly or may be cost-prohibitive.

**b. Alternative Embedding Models**

- **Self-hosted Models**: Consider models like [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) which may offer more flexibility.

---

#### **7. Process Chunks Sequentially and Aggregate Results**

**a. Individual Embeddings**

- **Embed Chunks Separately**: Process each chunk independently.
- **Store Separately**: Keep embeddings associated with their chunks.

**b. Aggregate During Retrieval**

- **Search Across Chunks**: When querying, retrieve relevant chunks and combine their information.
- **Reconstruct Context**: Use chunk indices or metadata to piece together the full context.

---

### **Implementing the Solution**

Here's how you can integrate these strategies into your existing pipeline:

#### **Step 1: Preprocess the Stored Procedure**

```python
# Read and compress the stored procedure
with open('large_stored_procedure.sql', 'r') as file:
    proc_text = file.read()

compressed_proc_text = compress_sql_code(proc_text)
```

#### **Step 2: Split the Stored Procedure**

```python
# Split using token-aware splitter
chunks = split_text_by_tokens(compressed_proc_text, tokenizer, max_tokens)
```

#### **Step 3: Embed the Chunks**

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Initialize the embedding model
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(model='text-embedding-ada-002')

# Embed each chunk
embeddings = embedding_model.embed_documents(chunks)
```

#### **Step 4: Create Documents with Metadata**

```python
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

documents = []
for idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    doc = Document(
        page_content=chunk,
        metadata={
            'chunk_index': idx,
            'procedure_name': 'Your_Procedure_Name',  # Extract if possible
            # Add more metadata as needed
        }
    )
    documents.append(doc)
```

#### **Step 5: Store Embeddings in FAISS**

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

# Create FAISS vector store
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embedding_model)
```

#### **Step 6: Perform Similarity Search**

```python
# Define your query
query = "Explain the data transformation logic in the stored procedure."

# Perform similarity search
results = vector_store.similarity_search(query)

# Aggregate results if necessary
combined_content = ' '.join([res.page_content for res in results])
```

#### **Step 7: Post-processing and Call Tree Generation**

- **Analyze Retrieved Chunks**: Use the content to generate call trees or perform further analysis.
- **Handle Dependencies**: If the stored procedure calls other procedures or functions, include them in your analysis.

---

### **Additional Tips**

#### **Estimate Tokens Accurately**

- **Use Tokenizer Beforehand**: Always estimate the number of tokens before embedding to avoid exceeding limits.
- **Average Token Length**: Note that the average token in English is about 4 characters, but this can vary.

#### **Adjust Chunk Sizes Dynamically**

- **Based on Content**: Some parts of the code may require smaller chunks due to complexity.
- **During Runtime**: Implement logic to adjust chunk sizes during processing.

#### **Leverage Hierarchical Embeddings**

- **Chunk-Level Embeddings**: Embed individual chunks.
- **Procedure-Level Embeddings**: Combine chunk embeddings to create an overall embedding for the stored procedure.

---

### **Conclusion**

By carefully splitting your large stored procedures into manageable chunks that stay within the token limit, you can effectively embed and process them using models like `text-embedding-ada-002`. Maintaining semantic integrity and context across chunks is crucial for accurate embeddings and meaningful search results.

---

### **Next Steps**

- **Implement the Splitting Logic**: Start by testing the splitting functions on your stored procedures.
- **Validate Chunk Integrity**: Ensure that chunks do not break code syntax and retain logical meaning.
- **Test Embeddings and Search**: Embed the chunks and perform sample queries to evaluate relevance.
- **Iterate and Optimize**: Adjust chunk sizes, overlaps, and splitting strategies based on results.
