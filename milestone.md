**Proposal for Milestone-Based Dataset Management**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal introduces a “milestone” concept to group related datasets, ensure they are published simultaneously, and maintain consistent linkage across different processes and timeframes. By implementing milestone-based versioning and leveraging dataset tags for quick filtering, consumers can easily identify and use the correct dataset bundle without needing to materialize massive tables. This approach enhances data integrity, simplifies maintenance, and accelerates downstream consumption.

## 2. Problem Statement

* **Missing Data Linkage Across Processes**

  * Datasets are often generated in separate processes at different times.
  * Without a unifying mechanism, related datasets can become out of sync or fail to reference each other properly.

* **Difficulty Identifying the Correct Dataset Bundle**

  * Consumers may not know which combination of dataset versions they should use.
  * There is no straightforward way to filter or discover “complete” dataset sets that belong together.

* **Inefficient Maintenance of Updated Datasets**

  * When one dataset in a group is updated, existing approaches often require materializing a large table that includes all datasets, even those that have not changed.
  * This wastes compute resources and increases publication time.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1 Milestone Concept

* **Definition**: A *milestone* is a named grouping of related datasets that must be published and consumed together.
* **Purpose**:

  1. Enforce simultaneous publication of all datasets in the group.
  2. Ensure intra-group linkage (foreign keys, join logic, etc.) is maintained.
  3. Provide a single reference point for downstream consumers to retrieve a consistent set of datasets.

### 3.2 Dataset Linkage

* **Linkage Requirement**: All datasets assigned to a milestone must reference one another correctly (e.g., via primary/foreign keys or standardized join keys).
* **Publication Constraint**: A milestone cannot be marked as “published” until every dataset within it has been loaded, validated, and passed QA checks.
* **Enforcement Mechanism**:

  1. For each dataset in the milestone, verify that its metadata (schema, keys, etc.) aligns with the others.
  2. Only when all datasets are ready, update the milestone’s status to “Published,” making the entire set available downstream.

### 3.3 Versioning and Attributes (Color Attribution)

* **Milestone Versions**:

  * Each milestone can have multiple versions (e.g., V1, V2, V3), reflecting the state of each dataset at a point in time.
* **Color/Attribute Tagging**:

  * We propose using a dataset metadata tag (e.g., `DATA_TAG`) to indicate version attributes.
  * Example: If all datasets in a milestone are tagged `FINAL`, then the milestone attribute `IS_FINAL = Y`.
  * Other tags (e.g., `DRAFT`, `REVIEWED`) can correspond to different milestone attributes or “colors” (e.g., green, yellow, red).
* **Consumer Filtering**:

  * Downstream users can filter on milestone attributes (or colors) to select only “finalized” dataset bundles, or choose a draft version for validation.

### 3.4 Implementation Details

1. **Milestone Table**

   * Create a centralized `Milestone` table with columns such as:

     * `Milestone_ID` (surrogate key)
     * `Milestone_Name` (e.g., “MILESTONE\_A”)
     * `Version_Number` (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
     * `Attribute` (e.g., “FINAL”, “DRAFT”, etc.)
     * `Publish_Date`
     * `Status` (e.g., “Pending”, “Published”, “Archived”)

2. **Dataset Registration**

   * Each dataset (d1, d2, d3, etc.) registers itself with a configuration that specifies:

     * Which `Milestone_Name` it belongs to.
     * Its own version number (e.g., d2\_V1, d2\_V2).
     * The dataset’s `DATA_TAG` (e.g., “FINAL”).

3. **Data Tag Mapping**

   * A simple lookup table or small reference view translates the dataset’s `DATA_TAG` into a milestone attribute/color. For example:

     | DATA\_TAG | Milestone Attribute | Color  |
     | --------- | ------------------- | ------ |
     | DRAFT     | IS\_DRAFT = Y       | Yellow |
     | REVIEWED  | IS\_REVIEWED = Y    | Orange |
     | FINAL     | IS\_FINAL = Y       | Green  |

4. **Publication Workflow**

   1. **Dataset Publishing**

      * Each individual process publishes or refreshes its dataset along with the `DATA_TAG` in its metadata.
      * Upon completion, the dataset registration service verifies schema correctness and inserts/updates an entry in the `Milestone_Dataset` staging area.
   2. **Milestone Aggregation**

      * A scheduled job (or event-driven trigger) checks all datasets for a given `Milestone_Name` and `Version_Number`.
      * If **all** datasets for that milestone version have status “Ready” and share a consistent `DATA_TAG` mapping, the milestone is marked as “Ready to Publish.”
   3. **Final Publish**

      * Once the milestone is “Ready to Publish,” an atomic operation:

        * Sets `Milestone.Status = 'Published'`,
        * Records the `Publish_Date`,
        * Captures the list of dataset versions (d1\_V1, d2\_V2, etc.) in a snapshot table.
   4. **Incremental Updates**

      * If a single dataset is updated (for example, d2 is updated to version 2 while d1 and d3 remain at version 1), the process becomes:

        1. Update d2’s metadata (set new version and `DATA_TAG`).
        2. Create a new milestone version (e.g., Milestone A, Version 2), linking d1\_V1, d2\_V2, and d3\_V1.
        3. Repeat the publication workflow for Milestone A, Version 2 only.

## 4. Use Cases and Examples

1. **Synchronized Publication**

   * **Scenario**: Datasets d1, d2, and d3 are generated by three different ETL pipelines at different times.
   * **Challenge**: Without milestones, d1 might be updated on Monday, d2 on Tuesday, and d3 on Wednesday, causing downstream consumers to see mismatched data.
   * **Milestone Solution**:

     1. Assign d1, d2, d3 to “Milestone\_A.”
     2. Each pipeline publishes its dataset with `DATA_TAG = FINAL` when it completes.
     3. Once all three pipelines finish, Milestone\_A Version 1 automatically becomes “Published.”
     4. Downstream jobs simply query “Milestone\_A Version 1 – FINAL” and guarantee consistency across all three.

2. **Incremental Versioning**

   * **Scenario**: After Milestone\_A Version 1 is published, d2 receives a data correction.
   * **Challenge**: We want to update d2 without forcing d1 and d3 to be reprocessed or reloaded.
   * **Milestone Solution**:

     1. ETL pipeline for d2 publishes d2\_V2 (with `DATA_TAG = FINAL`).
     2. The milestone service sees that d1 and d3 are still at V1, and produces “Milestone\_A Version 2” referencing (d1\_V1, d2\_V2, d3\_V1).
     3. Downstream consumers can choose either Version 1 or Version 2 of Milestone\_A depending on their needs.

3. **Attribute-Based Filtering**

   * **Scenario**: A data scientist wants only datasets that are marked “FINAL” for production modeling, ignoring any “DRAFT” or “REVIEWED” datasets.
   * **Challenge**: Ad hoc filtering by dataset tags is error-prone and requires manual cross-referencing.
   * **Milestone Solution**:

     1. Since “FINAL” maps to `IS_FINAL = Y` for the milestone, the data scientist simply queries `Milestone WHERE IS_FINAL = 'Y'`.
     2. They immediately obtain a list of published, production-ready milestone versions and the associated dataset versions.

## 5. Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**

   * Guarantees that related datasets are published together in a single, versioned bundle.
   * Eliminates mismatches that arise when datasets are updated at different times.

2. **Simplified Downstream Consumption**

   * Consumers query a single milestone reference instead of joining or validating individual dataset versions.
   * Easy filtering using milestone attributes/colors (e.g., `IS_FINAL = Y`).

3. **Efficient Resource Utilization**

   * Only the updated dataset version needs to be refreshed; unmodified datasets remain unchanged.
   * Avoids the need to materialize a monolithic table containing all datasets every time one changes.

4. **Clear Versioning History**

   * Every milestone version captures a snapshot of all involved datasets at a point in time.
   * Historical audits and rollbacks become straightforward.

5. **Metadata-Driven Automation**

   * The milestone service can automatically detect when all constituent datasets are “Ready,” flipping the milestone status to “Published.”
   * Reduces manual coordination between multiple ETL teams.

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Design Phase**

   * Finalize the schema for:

     * `Milestone` table
     * `Milestone_Dataset` staging table
     * `DATA_TAG` → milestone attribute mapping table

2. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

   * Select a pilot use case (e.g., datasets d1, d2, d3) to implement milestone logic.
   * Build minimal ETL scripts for each dataset to register with the milestone service.
   * Run end-to-end tests:

     * Publish d1, d2, d3 as “Milestone\_X Version 1.”
     * Update one dataset (e.g., d2\_V2) and confirm milestone version upgrade.

3. **Automation and Scheduling**

   * Create the milestone aggregation job (cron or event-driven).
   * Implement notifications/alerts when a milestone is “Ready to Publish” or if any dataset fails validation.

4. **Documentation & Training**

   * Draft a user guide for downstream consumers on how to query milestones and filter by attributes.
   * Hold a brief training session for ETL owners on how to register datasets and tag them appropriately.

5. **Rollout & Monitoring**

   * Gradually onboard additional dataset groups onto the milestone framework.
   * Monitor performance, detect failures or inconsistencies, and adjust rules as needed.
