Here's a refined **high-level step-by-step modernization plan** for addressing **data inconsistency and lack of linkage** by starting from the bottom up, as you described:

---

### 🧱 **Phase 1: Application-Centric Review (Bottom-Up Assessment)**

1. **Inventory All Data Consumers**

   * Identify and document all current applications consuming party/legal entity-level data.
   * Map each application to the specific dataset(s) and columns it uses.

2. **Identify Inconsistencies**

   * Review data usage across applications for the same business concepts.
   * Document inconsistencies in logic, values, and timing (e.g., one app gets daily, another hourly).

3. **Column Usage Gap Analysis**

   * Create a matrix comparing required columns per application vs. what exists in current datasets/views.
   * Identify missing columns or columns with conflicting definitions.

---

### 🔍 **Phase 2: Propose and Align on a Unified Source of Truth**

4. **Design a Unified DB View**

   * Propose a single DB view at the *party/legal entity* level that includes **all relevant columns**.
   * Ensure it's normalized, scalable, and can be consumed by all downstream systems.

5. **Column Mapping & Enrichment**

   * Map existing datasets to the unified view.
   * Add missing columns to the view with standardized business logic, or derive them upstream if needed.

6. **Data Quality & Performance Validation**

   * Run comparative queries to validate record counts, values, and outliers vs. legacy sources.
   * Benchmark performance across representative queries.

7. **Application Onboarding to Unified View**

   * Gradually update applications to point to the unified view instead of legacy datasets.
   * Establish rollback mechanisms and alerting during the cutover period.

---

### 🗃️ **Phase 3: Materialization for Performance and Stability**

8. **Materialize Unified Dataset**

   * Persist the unified view into physical DB tables as a materialized dataset.
   * Use ETL or Spark-based jobs to populate and update the materialized data regularly.

9. **Deprecate Redundant Sources**

   * Phase out previous fragmented sources once applications are migrated.
   * Archive datasets and document data lineage.

---

### 🔗 **Phase 4: Introduce Milestone-Based Linkage**

10. **Design the Milestone Model**

    * Define a milestone as a collection of related datasets (e.g., party, loan, position) that are aligned on business context (e.g., `cob_date`, `scenario`).
    * Assign a unique milestone ID and associated metadata (status, publish time, dependencies).

11. **Implement Dataset Linking Logic**

    * For each dataset, record its milestone association (e.g., via `milestone_id` FK).
    * Enable traceability and joins across datasets of varying granularity through shared milestone metadata.

---

### 🧩 **Phase 5: Orchestration and Publishing Logic**

12. **Define Dataset Dependencies**

    * Capture inter-dataset dependencies (e.g., loan → party, stress → loan+agg) in a metadata table.

13. **Trigger Milestone Publication**

    * Develop logic to determine when a milestone is "ready to publish" (i.e., all dependent datasets have been refreshed).

14. **Build an Orchestration Layer**

    * Orchestrate dataset refreshes via scheduling/triggering framework (e.g., Airflow, Flowable).
    * Ensure proper sequencing, failure handling, and milestone-level logging.

---

### 🏁 **Final State Benefits**

* All apps pull from a unified, consistent, validated data source.
* Datasets are linked across processes via milestones for lineage and auditing.
* Materialized datasets improve performance and reduce runtime joins.
* Orchestration ensures reliable and reproducible data production.
