Great question — understanding the difference between **dataset definition** and **dataset metadata** is key to designing a clean and scalable system.

## 🔍 Definitions and Differences

### 1. **Dataset Definition**

This is the **static, reusable configuration** that defines **what a dataset is**, regardless of when or how often it is created.

| Aspect   | Description                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose  | Defines the identity, schema, keys, and storage pattern for a dataset                      |
| Scope    | Shared across all versions (revisions) of a dataset                                        |
| Examples | Dataset name, schema, dataset key structure, storage type (file or DB), file path template |
| Analogy  | Like a “class” or blueprint in programming                                                 |

👉 **You define this once**, and reuse it whenever a new version (revision) of that dataset is created.

### 2. **Dataset Metadata**

This is the **dynamic, per-instance information** about a specific version (revision) of a dataset.

| Aspect   | Description                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Captures metadata about a specific dataset instance/version                                                             |
| Scope    | Unique for each combination of dataset + dataset key                                                                    |
| Examples | Dataset ID, revision number, key values (e.g., `cob_date=20250801`), `is_latest`, row count, file size, write timestamp |
| Analogy  | Like an “object” or instance of a class                                                                                 |

👉 Each time data is produced, you **register a new metadata record** using this info.

## 📎 Why You Should Split Them

| Reason                        | Explanation                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Separation of concerns**    | Dataset definition is about structure and identity; metadata is about lifecycle and status. Keeping them separate avoids confusion.       |
| **Reusability**               | You define a dataset once, then generate many metadata entries (one per revision). This avoids duplication.                               |
| **Flexibility**               | You can update metadata (e.g., add a new revision) without redefining the whole dataset structure.                                        |
| **Validation and Governance** | You can validate each revision against the dataset definition (e.g., schema enforcement) more easily when they are split.                 |
| **Scalability**               | Metadata tables will grow large (many rows), but definitions will remain small and stable — helps with query performance and maintenance. |

## 🧠 Summary

| Type                   | What it Describes                                      | How Often It Changes |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Dataset Definition** | What the dataset is (structure, storage rules)         | Rarely               |
| **Dataset Metadata**   | What was produced (specific version, time, size, path) | Frequently           |

Splitting them is not just clean architecture — it’s essential for supporting versioning, metadata registration, validation, and automation **at scale**.

Let me know if you'd like a sample schema for both tables, or a visual to explain this split to others.
