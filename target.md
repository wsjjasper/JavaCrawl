Got it — I’ll answer in English from now on.

Here’s a clean grouping of the 10 themes into four major categories:

# A. Catalog & Governance

**Covers:** 1 (Catalog incomplete), 6 (Metadata staleness/multiple sources of truth), 9 (Implicit governance)
**Focus:** Authoritative dataset definitions, controlled change management, auditable ownership and approvals.

# B. Lineage & Data Semantics

**Covers:** 2 (Imprecise lineage, multi-output), 7 (Heterogeneous formats not normalized)
**Focus:** Column-level lineage (direct vs. derived), standardized storage/format semantics across DB2/parquet/CSV/Excel.

# C. Orchestration & Execution Consistency

**Covers:** 3 (Inconsistent process definitions across engines), 4 (Brittle cross-system dependencies), 8 (Low adoption of declarative patterns)
**Focus:** Federated, job-level process descriptions; cross-engine dependency modeling; promote declarative patterns where feasible.

# D. Observability & Reliability

**Covers:** 5 (Siloed observability & SLAs), 10 (Missing run/SLA history)
**Focus:** Unified dataset+process SLA view with per-run history for trends, SLOs, and incident analytics.

If you’d like, I can add this grouping to the canvas document and include a small “scope boundaries & evidence checklist” for each category.
