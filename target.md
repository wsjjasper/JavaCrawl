Got it. Thanks for laying out the current state so thoroughly ‚Äî this really helps frame the discussion.
Before jumping into possible enhancements (like Camunda, ORK events, etc.), it makes sense to pause and summarize the **problem statements** clearly. That way, the proposal will show a strong ‚Äúwhy‚Äù before the ‚Äúhow.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve distilled, with some open questions for you:

---

## **Problem Statements**

### 1. Dataset Management & Metadata

* **Incomplete definitions**: Only a limited number of datasets are registered in the centralized definition table. Many datasets (especially legacy ones) lack consistent definitions.
* **Scattered metadata**: Information such as feed paths, upstream/downstream APIs, or Autosys job configs are not centrally tracked ‚Äî buried in job scripts instead.
* **Weak lineage**: Lineage is partial and imprecise. Multi-output processes aren‚Äôt well represented, and most legacy processes lack lineage entirely.
* **Format inconsistency**: DB2 dominates, but parquet/CSV/Excel are also in play. Metadata doesn‚Äôt unify these well.

**Questions for you**:

* Should all dataset definitions (even legacy/manual) be brought into scope, or only new/strategic datasets?
* Do you want lineage to go down to *field/column level*, or stop at dataset level?

---

### 2. Process & Dependency Management

* **Split worlds**: Autosys vs. Run Management ‚Äî no unified view, no seamless dependency management across them.
* **Workarounds**: File watchers and puller jobs are brittle, manual, and error-prone.
* **Limited declarative config**: Only Run Management processes have definitions with I/O metadata snapshots. Legacy Autosys jobs lack process-level metadata.
* **Heterogeneous tech stack**: Spark YAML framework exists but is lightly adopted; most processes are still Python/Java/Shell/DB2 SPs.

**Questions for you**:

* Is the goal to converge everything onto one orchestrator (Camunda/ORK), or should we build a ‚Äúfederated‚Äù model to unify across multiple engines?
* How deep should process metadata go (only job-level or also include step-level transformations)?

---

### 3. Observability & SLA

* **Fragmented monitoring**: SLA configs exist in one table, but only mapped to Autosys job names or Run Management request types.
* **Inconsistent reporting**: Some dashboards exist, but metadata and process state live in different silos. Manual effort is needed to gather them.
* **Limited SLA breach handling**: No standardized escalation model (immediate vs delayed). Dataset vs process SLA isn‚Äôt clearly differentiated.

**Questions for you**:

* Do you want SLA tracking at both dataset and process level?
* Should SLA instance data (per run, including breach/late arrival) be stored for audit/history, or only current status?

---

### 4. Architecture & Sustainability

* **Duplication of config**: Dataset metadata, process configs, Autosys JIL, and Run Management configs all overlap but live in different places.
* **Outdated quickly**: Because of this fragmentation, metadata is often stale.
* **Scalability risk**: Growing complexity of feeds and processes isn‚Äôt matched by automation in registration, dependency resolution, or monitoring.

**Questions for you**:

* Do you want to aim for *self-service onboarding* (developers/analysts register datasets & processes via UI/API), or keep it controlled centrally?
* Should modernization focus on **incremental retrofit** of legacy jobs, or a **greenfield rebuild** for strategic flows first?

üëâ If you confirm/refine these problem statements, the next step could be to cluster them into **themes** (e.g., Metadata, Orchestration, Observability) and then map them to possible solution paths (Camunda BPMN, ORK events, centralized catalog, etc.).

Would you like me to prepare a **one-page ‚ÄúProblem Landscape‚Äù slide** summarizing these gaps and open questions ‚Äî so you can use it to kick off brainstorming with your team?
