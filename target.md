Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre essentially trying to modernize and standardize a **data pipeline orchestration and dataset management framework** that today is fragmented across file watchers, Autosys dependencies, ad-hoc triggers, and custom scripts. Let me break this down for you in a **structured summary** and then propose **an action plan with options**.

---

## üîë Key Points (Current State & Challenges)

### 1. Dataset Characteristics

* **Variety**: CSV, Parquet, database extracts, custom formats with manifest.
* **Versioning**: Datasets have daily versions, but version tracking/management is ad-hoc.
* **Metadata**: No unified metadata management (format, schema, source, version, lineage).

### 2. Processing

* **Transformations**: Enrichment, derivation, joins, aggregation.
* **Dependencies**: Strong inter-dataset dependencies but handled manually (filewatcher/Autosys).
* **Engines**: Python, Java, Spark jobs without a unified abstraction layer.

### 3. Orchestration

* **Current**: Autosys jobs/boxes, file watcher triggers, UI-triggered ad-hoc runs.
* **Limitations**:

  * Dependency management is brittle (job vs. data dependency).
  * Limited observability (no central lineage, status tracking).
  * SLA monitoring is fragmented.

### 4. Downstream Consumption

* **Feeds**: To external systems, requiring SLA guarantees & notifications.
* **Database Tables/Views**: Used for analytics and reporting.

### 5. Special Cases

* **Ad-hoc runs**: Triggered from UI (e.g., adjustments), should cascade downstream impact.
* **Retry & Recovery**: Not standardized, often manual.

## üéØ Refactor Goals

1. **Centralize dataset management**: metadata, versioning, schema, lineage.
2. **Shift from job-based to data-driven orchestration** (datasets as first-class citizens).
3. **Standardize dependency management** (dataset A ready ‚Üí triggers dataset B).
4. **Provide observability**: lineage, SLA, retries, error handling.
5. **Support both scheduled and ad-hoc runs consistently**.
6. **Make it tech-agnostic** (works with Python, Java, Spark, etc.).

## üõ† Potential Action Plan

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation

* **Metadata Layer**

  * Define dataset metadata model: source, format, schema, partitioning, version, lineage.
  * Implement a **metadata store** (options: custom DB tables, Hive Metastore, Data Catalog).
* **Versioning & Auditability**

  * Standardize dataset version naming convention (date-based, incremental).
  * Store dataset lifecycle events (created, validated, consumed).

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Orchestration Refactor

* **Choose orchestration approach**:

  1. **Workflow orchestration**: Airflow, Luigi, Prefect.
  2. **Dataflow orchestration**: Dagster, Flyte (datasets as first-class objects).
  3. **Hybrid**: Still run under Autosys, but externalize dataset dependency logic.
* **Data dependency graph**

  * Express jobs as transformations **from dataset X ‚Üí dataset Y**.
  * Automatically build DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) of processing.

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Execution Layer

* **Standardize execution interface** (abstract away Python, Java, Spark).
* **Implement retry & recovery strategies** (checkpointing, idempotent writes).
* **Ad-hoc runs**

  * Trigger via metadata store ‚Üí recompute dependencies selectively.

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Observability & SLA

* **Monitoring**: Track dataset readiness, failures, and delays.
* **SLA engine**: Notifications when downstream feeds/tables are at risk.
* **Lineage & Impact analysis**:

  * Show ‚Äúif dataset X fails, which downstream datasets/systems are impacted.‚Äù

## üìå Options for Refactor Strategy

### Option A ‚Äì Incremental (Low Disruption)

* Keep Autosys for scheduling.
* Build a **metadata service + dependency tracker**.
* Wrap existing jobs to register dataset events.
* Add lineage & SLA monitoring gradually.

### Option B ‚Äì Modern Orchestrator (Medium Disruption)

* Adopt **Airflow/Prefect** as the main orchestration tool.
* Migrate workflows gradually from Autosys.
* Implement dataset abstraction in orchestrator.

### Option C ‚Äì Dataset-First Framework (High Transformation)

* Adopt a **data-native orchestrator** (Dagster, Flyte).
* Treat datasets as entities, jobs as transformations.
* Unified metadata, lineage, observability, and orchestration.
* Requires retraining and phased migration.

---

‚úÖ **Recommendation** (given you are in a bank-like environment with Autosys and mixed tech):

* Start with **Option A (Incremental)** ‚Üí build metadata + dataset dependency tracking layer.
* Then migrate critical pipelines to **Option B (Airflow/Prefect)** where more flexibility is needed.
* Keep Option C as a long-term strategic vision once maturity and buy-in are achieved.

Would you like me to also **draft a proposed target architecture diagram (conceptual)** showing datasets, metadata, orchestration, and execution layers? That could help you pitch this refactor more clearly to your stakeholders.
