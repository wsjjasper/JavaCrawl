Good question üëç. Refactoring existing data modeling usually needs a structured plan, otherwise it easily becomes a mess or breaks downstream systems. A typical plan has 5‚Äì7 phases:


---

1. Assessment & Discovery

Inventory current models: ER diagrams, schemas, datasets, tables, processes using them.

Identify pain points: redundancy, poor naming, inconsistent datatypes, hard-to-query joins, missing relationships, performance issues.

Map dependencies: who/what consumes the data (reports, apps, feeds, APIs).



---

2. Requirement Alignment

Clarify business use cases: what the model must support today and in the near future.

Check SLA & compliance needs: retention, data lineage, audit, security.

Define target principles: normalization vs denormalization, naming standards, domain-driven boundaries.



---

3. Gap Analysis

Compare current state vs target model.

Mark:

tables/fields to drop (unused/duplicated),

tables/fields to add (missing business attributes),

relationships to change (1:n vs n:m).




---

4. Refactor Design

Draft new logical model (conceptual + ERD).

Plan migration path: keep backward compatibility vs break-and-rebuild.

Versioning: decide if old and new models co-exist for a while (shadow tables, views, APIs).

Data quality rules: define transformations, cleansing, validations.



---

5. Implementation Planning

Create migration scripts: schema changes, DDL, ETL adjustments.

Automate tests: schema validation, data consistency, SLA checks.

Backfill strategy: how to move or transform existing data.

Rollout plan: big bang vs phased (module/domain by domain).



---

6. Execution & Validation

Run schema changes in staging/test with real workloads.

Validate with data profiling, query performance, business reports.

Involve data consumers for UAT (User Acceptance Testing).



---

7. Rollout & Monitoring

Deploy gradually if possible.

Monitor: query performance, data latency, feed failures, user adoption.

Establish a feedback loop for further refinements.



---

üëâ In short: Assess ‚Üí Align ‚Üí Gap ‚Üí Redesign ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Monitor.
It‚Äôs usually iterative ‚Äî you rarely finish in one go.

Would you like me to draft a sample refactoring project plan (with timeline and tasks) that you could adapt for your case?
