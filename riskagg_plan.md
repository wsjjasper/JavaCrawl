## üß© Concept Overview ‚Äî Measure-Driven Parallel Risk Aggregation

**Goal:**
Modernize credit risk aggregation by executing independent **measure groups** in parallel, triggered when their **required input datasets** are ready.
This enables **data-driven orchestration**, **incremental recompute**, and **performance scalability** across hundreds of measures and multiple data domains (inventory, treasury, loan, PE, settlement, etc.).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Principles

1. **Measure-Driven Execution**

   * Each measure (or measure group) defines its **inputs**, **dimensions**, and **aggregation formula**.
   * When all input datasets for that measure are ‚ÄúReady-Ready-Ready,‚Äù aggregation starts automatically.

2. **Parallelism by Readiness**

   * Measures run independently and concurrently, avoiding global blocking.
   * Only recompute measures whose inputs changed.

3. **Data-Driven Orchestration**

   * Orchestration layer (Spark, Snowflake Tasks, or BPMN/ORK+) determines run order based on dependency and milestone metadata.

4. **Final Merge by Dimension Grain**

   * Once all partial measures are done, a controlled merge aligns them on standardized **dimension grains** (party, LE, country, sector, etc.) to produce consolidated outputs (e.g., `Total_Net_Exposure = Inventory + Treasury + Loan`).

## üß± Metadata & Governance Layers

| Layer                  | Key Entities                                                                         | Purpose                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dataset Definition** | Dataset ID, COB date, scenario, revision, readiness                                  | Identify when each dataset is ready for consumption   |
| **Measure Definition** | Measure ID, Input Datasets, Formula, Dimensions, Dependencies, Additivity, FX Policy | Drive orchestration and ensure semantic correctness   |
| **Grain Registry**     | Grain Type, Keys, Bridge Rules                                                       | Standardize dimension alignment and prevent explosion |
| **Snapshot Contract**  | COB, Scenario, Revision, FX Version, Dim Version                                     | Enforce consistency across all measures in one run    |
| **Measure Instance**   | Run ID, Snapshot ID, Status, Metrics, SLA                                            | Track execution lineage and performance per measure   |
| **Merge Definition**   | Merge Rules, Output Dataset, Dimension Keys                                          | Define how to combine measures into portfolio view    |

## üßÆ Execution Flow

1. **Dataset Ready Check:**
   Monitor dataset milestones; when all required datasets for a measure are ready, trigger that measure‚Äôs aggregation job.

2. **Parallel Aggregation:**
   Spark/Snowflake jobs compute measures independently by their defined grain.

3. **Intermediate Publish:**
   Each measure writes atomic ‚Äúlong‚Äù fact output:

   ```
   (snapshot_id, grain_keys..., measure_name, value)
   ```

4. **Merge Stage:**
   Controlled merge (join by grain) builds the final ‚Äúwide‚Äù table or report dataset.

5. **Promotion:**
   After validation, atomic swap to mark snapshot as current; older revisions remain immutable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls & Mitigations

| Risk                            | Description                                                     | Mitigation                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mixed As-Of States**          | Measures using data from different COBs                         | Enforce **Snapshot Contract**; all measures must share same as-of snapshot |
| **Hidden Measure Dependencies** | Derived measures (e.g., Net = Gross ‚àí Collateral) run too early | Define **measure dependency DAG** and use ‚Äúfamily barriers‚Äù                |
| **Dimension Drift**             | Inconsistent Party/LE hierarchies                               | Maintain **conformed dimension registry** with effective dates             |
| **Double Counting**             | Overlapping measures (e.g., exposure netting sets)              | Use **netting domain IDs** and enforce mutual exclusivity                  |
| **Job Explosion**               | Too many small measure tasks                                    | Batch into **measure families** by common inputs/grains                    |
| **Skew & Shuffle Overhead**     | Large counterparties cause skew                                 | Pre-aggregate by partition, apply salting or broadcast joins               |
| **Rerun Storms**                | Late or corrected data retriggers everything                    | Apply **debounce window** + **impact graph** for targeted reruns           |
| **Data Corruption**             | Parallel writers overwrite same partition                       | Use **ACID sinks**, write to temp ‚Üí validate ‚Üí atomic promote              |
| **Explainability Gaps**         | Difficult to trace final numbers                                | Persist **lineage breadcrumbs** and expose drill-through metadata          |

## üß≠ Implementation Recommendations

* Use **Spark DAG or Camunda BPMN** to resolve measure + dataset dependencies dynamically.
* Persist intermediate outputs in **Parquet/Delta/Snowflake tables** for reusability.
* Build an **Orchestration Service** that:

  * Reads metadata from `Measure_Definition`.
  * Resolves dependencies and readiness.
  * Launches jobs in parallel with adaptive concurrency.
  * Triggers downstream merge once all are complete.
* Apply **observability hooks** to track SLA, input freshness, and lineage per measure.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

* The approach is **feasible, performant, and maintainable** when supported by strong metadata governance.
* It transforms the current system into a **data-driven orchestration model** rather than code-hardwired dependencies.
* The main success factors are:

  1. **Consistent snapshot control**
  2. **Measure dependency awareness**
  3. **Standardized dimension alignment**
  4. **Atomic-then-wide publishing pattern**
  5. **Strong observability and lineage**
