**Background**

The legacy **CRCD** process was originally developed to perform end‑to‑end aggregation of credit data across multiple source systems. Over the years, new calculation rules, exception‑handling branches, and temporary workarounds have been layered on, resulting in:

- **Tight coupling** of aggregation steps  
  Each calculation stage depends on the output of one or more upstream stages, with many hidden or poorly documented interdependencies.  
- **Opaque logic**  
  Key business rules live in embedded scripts and hard‑coded SQL, making it difficult for new team members (or downstream processes) to understand or validate results.  
- **Long run times**  
  As data volumes have grown, the monolithic nature of CRCD has driven processing times up, often requiring manual intervention to diagnose performance bottlenecks.  
- **Modernization drag**  
  Any new or refactored pipeline that needs CRCD outputs must reverse‑engineer its dependencies. This adds significant overhead, increases risk of regression, and slows delivery of updated data‑processing services.

Because of these challenges, we are seeing frequent delays and complexity spikes whenever CRCD feeds into our modern data‑processing framework. In order to break this bottleneck, we need to **decompose and simplify** the CRCD process:

1. **Dependency mapping**  
   Identify and document all upstream/downstream dependencies between aggregation stages.  
2. **Modular refactoring**  
   Extract discrete calculation units into standalone components with clear inputs/outputs.  
3. **Performance tuning**  
   Streamline or rewrite the heaviest aggregation steps to reduce overall run time.  
4. **Clear documentation**  
   Produce a living design doc that describes each calculation’s purpose, parameters, and data requirements.

By undertaking this analysis and refactoring effort, we will reduce processing times, lower the risk of regression, and pave the way for fully modernized, maintainable aggregation pipelines.
